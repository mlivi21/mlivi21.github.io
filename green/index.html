            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p style="text-indent:15px;">The Green Foundation was founded in August 2005 and is a non-profit organization that aims to assist and uplift rural communities with the support of environmental projects. We have raised more than R 4 million to date and have won the Hope Award in 2007 and 2016. To date, we have assisted 45 rural communities in India, USA and Australia and planted more than 30,000 trees. For a full outline of our projects per area, please see our project booklet, attached. Our staff currently includes two full time project coordinators, a marketing coordinator and five administrative staff members. We also have four part time volunteers during various stages of the year. Our main message is that poverty and environmental degradation are intrinsically linked. By educating communities to respect the environment, opportunities for income generation are created.

        <h1>The General Public</h1>
        <p>75% of our funding comes from individuals who hear about our message through our marketing channels. The remainder comes from corporate sponsorship and internal profit generation (such as fundraising activities and sale of our branded merchandise).</p>

    <div class="business">
        <h1>Business</h1>
        <p>Businesses contribute 15% to our funding. We would like to strengthen our focus on corporate sponsorship during 2017 and use the website to support co-branded sponsorship projects like the SASA green campaign.</p>

        <h1>Volunteering students</h1>
        <p>Once a year we run a volunteer program in conjunction with Rand University. Social studies students donate 100 hours of their time to an NGO of their choice as part of their year-end thesis. We typically receive 500 hours donated each year. The website should act as a recruitment drive for these volunteers, as well as other non-student volunteers.</p>

        <p>We have been featured in a variety of local magazines and radio stations. We would like the website to attract further positive media attention.</p>
